- console.trace() functionality
- Provide file and line numbers to client of where console.log() was called
- Pass data through to client, even if there's a fatal exception
- Support cyclical objects by overriding JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse(). Have a look at 'cycle.js' here: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
- Send full object representation, including function()'s
- Is it possible to rebuild full objects including inheritance?
